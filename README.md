## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Marizabel, a Data Analyst with a diverse background in process development, sales, and leadership. With a strong foundation in Data Analytics and Computer Science, Iâ€™m planning to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Data Science in the near future. I specialize in applying Lean and Six Sigma methodologies, integrating these principles into every project to streamline processes, reduce redundancies, and enhance the accuracy of data-driven solutions.

In my previous roles, Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience working with complex datasets, focusing on maintaining data cleanliness and precision to deliver actionable business insights. My expertise includes integrating data from various internal sources while also thinking creatively to incorporate external data, providing a more comprehensive analysis and a fuller picture.

In my free time I enjoy working on data projects that not only enchance my analytical skills and allow me to explore new tools, but also are a bit of fun and entertainment ðŸ˜„
